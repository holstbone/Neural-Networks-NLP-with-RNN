# Neural-Networks-NLP-with-RNN

This paper addresses how the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) RNN concepts provide exceptional performance in sequence-based data such as
natural language (text). In our experiments we were able to achieve 90.2% Test Accuracy with
LSTM neural network techniques. Building and deploying predictive models using RNN and
LSTM neural networks, which benefits todayâ€™s information retrieval systems such as Google,
has developed remarkably quickly in the past few years and is an ever important facet of
machine learning and artificial intelligence.
